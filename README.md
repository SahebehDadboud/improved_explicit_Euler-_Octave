# improved_explicit_Euler-_Octave
Implement in Matlab/Octave the explicit Euler method and the improved explicit Euler method. Test my functions on the Predator-prey equations (Lotka/Volterra).
for equidistant time discretization for the time-interval t= [0, 20]. Compare the results
of the methods for the two step sizes h = 1.50 and h = 1.500 by plotting the resulting
trajectories in a y1/y2 plot.
